## Light Stand for Philips Hue Play Light bar

The default holder for the Philips light were not optimal for my setup.

So I designed my own and it works well behind my PC screen.

The full files and information can be found on the specific [Otteri-Synth Repository](https://github.com/Fauli/otteri-synth).


## Cable holders for ceiling

My ceiling has a canal that was ideal for hiding a cable to a lamp, but the cable was to thin to properly put into the canal.

Another challange was that the canal changes width every 15 cm. So I created a piece that can be scaled to different sizes.

## Chair Leg replacement pieces 

My father in law asked if I can design some chair replacement for this dining table chair. The old ones were starting to get torn, so the idea was to create new ones with a sunken in surface for pieces of felt.

The original piece is on the left and the new piece is on the right.
